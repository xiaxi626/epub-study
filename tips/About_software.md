## Jutoh Epubbuilder Dobby Word
Jutoh 新版本无汉化补丁，可使用旧补丁，使用 Jutoh 后仍需使用Sigil等软件精排。 Jutoh 软件内的模板不错，精益制作组网站有不少不错的电子书，给的模板也不错。

Epubbuilder是掌上书苑推出的软件，还行，不过用sigil会提示修复。

Dobby 制作的电子书适合在多看阅读器上阅读，如果想提升在其他阅读器的阅读体验，建议仅采用 Dobby 的部分样式。

使用Word制作电子书的朋友制作前要仔细翻阅Word文档，确定有哪些样式，如果文档页数多要进行拆分（不太建议复制到sigil中拆分，虽然sigil吧的修改版能扛得住）。把文字复制到Dreamweaver编辑区，或者生成筛选过的网页（生成完整网页文件也是可以的，body区域差不多），然后替换代码。

## Jutoh Epubbuilder Dobby Word
There is no Chinese patch in the new version of Jutoh, and the old patch can be used. After using Jutoh, you still need to use Sigil and other software for fine sorting. The templates in the Jutoh software are good. There are many good e-books on the lean production team website, and the templates are also good.

Eupbbuilder is the software launched by Handheld Books, which is OK, but sigil will prompt for repair.

The e-books produced by Dobby are suitable for reading on multi reader. If you want to improve your reading experience in other readers, you are recommended to use only some styles of Dobby.

Those who use Word to make e-books should carefully read the Word document before making it to determine which styles are available. If the document has a large number of pages, they should split it (it is not recommended to copy it to sigil for splitting, although the modified version of sigil bar can bear it). Copy the text to the Dreamweaver editing area, or generate a filtered web page (it is also possible to generate a complete web page file, similar to the body area), and then replace the code.
